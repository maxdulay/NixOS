#A one file NixOS configuration
One of the biggest reasons I wanted to try on NixOS is because of the idea of having a single config file to control everything on my computer. To my dismay, most configurations introduce modularity. While I can see the benefits of introducing modularity how it is still better than the systems in other operating systems, I JUST WANTED THE ONE FILE.
